              "  xxmaj it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics , which is fine . xxmaj although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years , the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying : \" xxmaj are n't you just blown away by this ! \" xxmaj well , not really . xxmaj these are n't earth shattering revelations anymore . xxmaj at any rate , i was already familiar with quantum theory , and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations , etc . is not new . \n",

              "  xxmaj the main problem i have with this movie , however , is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism . i do n't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism , but quantum mechanics does n't really have anything to do with these things , and it should be kept separate . xxmaj the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you , hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better . xxmaj the reasoning is completely ridiculous , and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory . xxmaj for every so called \" expert \" that they interviewed for this film , there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree . xxmaj they would point out , quite rightly , that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness . \n",

              " \n",
              "  xxmaj it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics , which is fine . xxmaj although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years , the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying : \" xxmaj are n't you just blown away by this ! \" xxmaj well , not really . xxmaj these are n't earth shattering revelations anymore . xxmaj at any rate , i was already familiar with quantum theory , and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations , etc . is not new . \n",

              "  xxmaj the main problem i have with this movie , however , is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism . i do n't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism , but quantum mechanics does n't really have anything to do with these things , and it should be kept separate . xxmaj the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you , hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better . xxmaj the reasoning is completely ridiculous , and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory . xxmaj for every so called \" expert \" that they interviewed for this film , there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree . xxmaj they would point out , quite rightly , that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness . \n",

              " \n",
              "  xxmaj it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics , which is fine . xxmaj although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years , the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying : \" xxmaj are n't you just blown away by this ! \" xxmaj well , not really . xxmaj these are n't earth shattering revelations anymore . xxmaj at any rate , i was already familiar with quantum theory , and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations , etc . is not new . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj the main problem i have with this movie , however , is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism . i do n't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism , but quantum mechanics does n't really have anything to do with these things , and it should be kept separate . xxmaj the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you , hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better . xxmaj the reasoning is completely ridiculous , and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory . xxmaj for every so called \" expert \" that they interviewed for this film , there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree . xxmaj they would point out , quite rightly , that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness . \n",
