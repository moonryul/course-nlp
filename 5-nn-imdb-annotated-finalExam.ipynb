              "  xxmaj ultimately , xxup sac xxup ii is pretty boring , and i really did want to sleep away the camp . xxmaj the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them . xxmaj if you 're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp , i recommend xxmaj club xxmaj dread . xxmaj if your channel surfing takes you across this one , check and see what else is on .,xxbos xxmaj wow . xxmaj some movies just leave me speechless . xxmaj this was undeniably one of those movies . xxmaj when i left the theatre , not a single word came to my mouth . xxmaj all i had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half . xxmaj unfortunately , it did n't work . xxmaj honestly , this movie has nothing to recommend . xxmaj the humor was at the first grade level , at best , the acting was overly silly , and the plot was astronomically far - fetched . i xxunk pledge never to see an other movie starring xxmaj chris xxmaj kattan or any other cast - member of xxup snl .,xxbos xxmaj as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie . xxmaj then i watched it . xxmaj the acting was n't the best . xxmaj that 's forgivable . xxmaj it 's the message that 's not : xxmaj give xxmaj jesus your life and everything will change - you 'll tackle better , make amazing catches , stop fumbling , start making touchdown passes , and even make the playoffs . xxmaj all because xxmaj jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into xxmaj all - xxmaj american athletes . i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals . xxmaj but wait , that 's not all . xxmaj you 'll get a brand new truck , a $ 6000 raise , and you and your wife 's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice . xxup then you 'll win the state championship because xxmaj god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he 's ever kicked before - and into the wind , no less - all because \" xxmaj god wanted him to make it . \" xxmaj then you 'll win the state championship again the next year . xxmaj none of this good stuff would have happened if the team had n't chosen to follow xxmaj jesus will all their hearts . \n",
              " \n",
              "  xxmaj here 's what i took away from the movie : xxmaj god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it 's all about making our lives better , easier , and more enjoyable . xxmaj he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games . xxmaj which bible is this story based on ? i 'll bet xxmaj saint xxmaj stephen wished he 'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death . xxmaj someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following xxmaj jesus . xxmaj it would have saved them all a lot of trouble .\n",
