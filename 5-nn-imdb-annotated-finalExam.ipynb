              "  xxmaj it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics , which is fine . xxmaj although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years , the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying : \" xxmaj are n't you just blown away by this ! \" xxmaj well , not really . xxmaj these are n't earth shattering revelations anymore . xxmaj at any rate , i was already familiar with quantum theory , and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations , etc . is not new . \n",

              "  xxmaj the main problem i have with this movie , however , is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism . i do n't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism , but quantum mechanics does n't really have anything to do with these things , and it should be kept separate . xxmaj the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you , hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better . xxmaj the reasoning is completely ridiculous , and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory . xxmaj for every so called \" expert \" that they interviewed for this film , there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree . xxmaj they would point out , quite rightly , that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness . \n",

              "  xxmaj the main problem i have with this movie , however , is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism . i do n't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism , but quantum mechanics does n't really have anything to do with these things , and it should be kept separate . xxmaj the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you , hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better . xxmaj the reasoning is completely ridiculous , and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory . xxmaj for every so called \" expert \" that they interviewed for this film , there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree . xxmaj they would point out , quite rightly , that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness . \n",

              "  xxmaj by far the worst part of \" xxmaj raptor xxmaj island \" is the animation of the raptors . xxmaj that 's right -- the selling point of the film is the worst aspect . xxmaj the animation is n't just bad , it 's subpar . i ca n't even express the hilarity of cartoons this cheesy . xxmaj and when they get shot ? xxmaj red splats like one would see in an old video game . xxmaj even the airplane , helicopter and xxmaj navy ship are cartoons ... how hard is it to get a model plane ? xxmaj please do n't see \" xxmaj raptor xxmaj island \" unless you need a good laugh or want to get sickeningly drunk . xxmaj sure , you probably want to see it before you see \" xxmaj raptor xxmaj island 2 \" ( which seems to be getting better reviews ) . xxmaj but just avoiding it entirely is your best bet . xxmaj the closest thing i can compare it to is \" xxmaj pinata : xxmaj survival xxmaj island \" , and unfortunately this film makes the pinata look good by comparison . xxmaj you have been warned .,xxbos xxmaj this is one creepy underrated xxmaj gem with chilling performances and a fantastic xxunk xxmaj all the characters are great , and the story was awesome , plus i thought the ending was really xxunk xxmaj the plot was great , and it never bored me , plus while the child actors were bad , they gave me the xxunk xxmaj this happened to be on the space channel a while ago , so i decided to check it out and tape it , i read some good reviews from fellow horror fans , i must say i agree with them , it 's very creepy , and suspenseful , plus xxmaj strother xxmaj martin , was fantastic in his role , as the xxmaj satan worshiper . xxmaj it has tons of creepy atmosphere , and it keeps you guessing throughout , plus all the characters were very likable , and you really start to root for xxmaj ben and his xxunk xxmaj it has plenty of disturbing moments , and the film really shocked me at times , plus , it 's extremely well made on a low xxunk xxmaj this is one creepy underrated gem , with chilling performances and a fantastic finale ! , i highly recommend this one!. xxmaj the xxmaj direction is very good!. xxmaj bernard mceveety does a very good job here , with great camera work , creating a lot of creepy atmosphere , and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. xxmaj ther is a little bit of blood and gore . xxmaj we get a severed leg , lots of bloody corpses , bloody slit throat , slicing and dicing , decapitation , and an impaling . xxmaj the xxmaj acting is xxunk xxmaj strother xxmaj martin is fantastic here ! as the xxmaj satan worshiper , he is extremely creepy , very convincing , was quite chilling , was extremely intense , seemed to be enjoying himself , and just did a fantastic job xxunk xxmaj charles xxmaj bateman is great as the xxmaj dad , he was very caring , very likable , and gave a good show ! , i liked him lots . xxup l.q. xxmaj jones is awesome as the xxmaj sheriff , he was funny , on top of things , looked very young , had a cool character , and just did an awesome job xxunk xxmaj ahna xxmaj capri is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do pretty well . xxmaj charles xxmaj robinson overacted to the extreme as the xxmaj priest and did n't convince me one bit ! , and that laugh of his was especially bad . xxmaj geri xxmaj reischl is actually decent as the daughter , she was somewhat likable , and only got on my nerves a couple times , i rather liked her . xxmaj alvy xxmaj moore was goofy , but very likable in his role as xxmaj tobey i dug him!. xxmaj rest of the cast do good . xxmaj overall i highly recommend it!. * * * 1 / 2 out of 5,xxbos xxmaj aside from the gross factual inaccuracies of this movie ( ie king xxmaj richard having a son and that son replacing xxmaj john on the throne ) this movie was a sweet love tale full of adventure . i 'm sure that this movie will appeal to the younger generation of girls and boys .,xxbos xxmaj the special effects again are superb but this is xxmaj finding xxmaj nemo in reverse i.e the parents get taken away and xxmaj pi ( xxmaj nemo ) is left behind , if you have n't seen xxmaj finding xxmaj nemo you will like it . \n",
